I created those little tables you put in the pizza box.
I spent my life working at the orphanage I grew up at.
I died doing what I loved, being a firefighter.
I love cleaning graffiti with powerwashers! It’s satisfying!
There's nothing more satisfying than saving a hurt baby bird.
I had a good life, and I died well, surrounded by loved ones.
I just found out I picked up over 5 tons of trash in my life!
I loved spending time volunteering at the animal shelter!
Sometimes, I’d bring donuts and coffee for my co-workers.
The best workout is helping shovel other people's driveways.
