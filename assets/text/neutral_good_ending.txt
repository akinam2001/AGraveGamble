If meant to go to heaven, they were an award winning chef
Communicated with their team and always commented and documented their code
Only ever took one piece, and let his friends pick first
Painted Murals for the community
Defended innocent people who couldn’t afford representation
Worked hard to unveil dark conspiracies and was a champion of the truth
It’s an honest mistake
wrote uplifting children’s stories
A fantastic song writer who showed their affection through art
Was going to finish with “HAVA nice day!”
