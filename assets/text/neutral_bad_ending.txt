If meant to go to hell, they put pineapple on pizza
Only started making this project thursday afternoon
Would steal all the candy from unattended bowls
Spray Painted inappropriate graffiti
Defended corporations ensuring they were not held accountable
Was a true master of clickbait
He was microwaving leftover fish… with the breakroom microwave!
Wrote THOSE fanfictions
Frequently sang their songs loudly, outside their “lover’s” house, at 2am
Was going to finish with “HAVA terrible day.”
